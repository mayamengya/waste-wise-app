## Problem Scope

As urban populations grow, effective and sustainable waste management becomes crucial. Manual inspection and photographic records pose challenges in monitoring urban garbage areas, leading to inefficiencies. Our project addresses this issue by introducing an automatic detection method using AI, enhancing efficiency and tackling urban waste challenges.

## Solution

Introducing WasteWise, a user-friendly app leveraging open-source AI tools for image detection. Our approach semi-automates waste inspection, ensuring consistent, reliable, and time-efficient assessments. By combining advanced image recognition technology with community engagement, WasteWise aims to improve waste management at both individual and city levels.
